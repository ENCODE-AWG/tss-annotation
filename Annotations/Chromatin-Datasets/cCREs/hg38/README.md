Each cCRE file contains 926,535 cCREs classified based on biochemical features
in the labeled cell type"

PLS = promoter-like signatures
pELS = proximal enhancer-like signatures
dELS = distal enhancer-like signatures
DNase-H3K4me3 = do not overlap annotated TSS, high H3K4me3 and DNase, low H3K27ac
CTCF-only = only high DNase and CTCF signal
DNase-only = only high DNase signal
Low-DNase = low DNase signal


{cellType}-PLS-Overlap-Groups.bed

Contain all PLS in each cell type annotated as whether they overlap:
R = rampage
C = cage
P = pacbio
